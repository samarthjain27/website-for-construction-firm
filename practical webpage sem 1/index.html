  Dear Colleagues, 

At Builders and Building , we are 'dreamers and doers.' Making our dream a reality isn't just about doing what is impossible, it's also about doing what is right.Our Code of Conduct doesn’t exist in isolation. It is underpinned by applicable laws and regulations and our supporting policies, all of which provide you with additional and essential guidance.

We are proud of our NEOM Values and how they inform the expected behaviors we ask everyone at NEOM to uphold. Our Values support the standards set out in this Code and should help provide you with guidance about how you should act and behave. <br><br><br>While we seek to establish a turning point in our relationship with technology and the world around us, we need to remember that future generations will measure our success not only by what we achieve, but also by how we achieve it. As NEOM grows, and the number of those sharing in our dream increases, this way of working needs to be defined and set out clearly, so that it can be understood by everyone.

Our Code of Conduct, which you are about to read, was created with exactly this aim in mind.

Our Code of Conduct sets out what we expect of those who work for and represent NEOM, including its subsidiaries and people. At its core, our Code speaks to the responsibilities everyone at NEOM has to act with honesty and integrity.

Our Code of Conduct was built to reflect our vision of NEOM and represent our exceptional standards and values. I am grateful to all who participated and were involved in the conception, development, and refinement of this important document.

Our Code offers us solid foundations from which we must build. Demonstrating our high standards of ethical conduct and integrity set out in our Code will empower you with confidence and inspire those you work with to do the same. As our bold vision becomes a reality, we must make the principles of our Code, together with our Values, a part of our daily working lives. This means making use of the range of further information, resources, and points of contact to which our Code of Conduct guides us. Importantly, it also means speaking up when we encounter behaviors or business decisions that do not align with the Code.

By modeling our ways of working on the NEOM Code of Conduct, we can ensure that our dreams are not only achieved but also achieved in the right way.
